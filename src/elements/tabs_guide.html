<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h4>Use when</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    You want to quickly switch between sibling views underneath a larger organizing
    principle/context
  </li>

  <li>You want to organize content into meaningful sections that occupy less screen space</li>

  <li>Add visual consistency</li>
</ul>

<table class="table table-bordered bg-white" style="max-width: 334px">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="${require('../img/guide/elements--tabs-example.png')}" alt="Tabs example">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>
        Tabs should be related to each other and fall under one category (i.e. in-model and browse
        in SketchUp styles panel)
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Don’t use</h4>

<ul>
  <li>As the primary means of navigation</li>

  <li>To group unrelated content</li>

  <li>To organize pieces of content that need to be seen by the user at the same time</li>

  <li>To hide primary user action elements</li>

  <li>To hide critical content</li>
</ul>

<h4>Visual language</h4>

<h6>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Tabs should always be placed on top of the content they represent</li>

  <li>
    Tabs differ from primary forms of navigation, such as Navbars, in that they are considered to be
    related to each other (i.e. types of media, genres of music, etc…)
  </li>

  <li>Users shouldn’t need to simultaneously see content from multiple tabs</li>

  <li>The currently selected tab should be appropriately highlighted</li>

  <li>Always have one tab pre-selected</li>

  <li>
    Tabs should be easy to scan and thus should have short, meaningful labels or icons. Avoid long
    text labels that don’t truncate or wrap.
  </li>

  <li>Labels should either be all text or all icons, not both intermixed</li>

  <li>Avoid nesting tabs</li>

  <li>Make unselected tabs visible to avoid potentially hiding features/content from the user</li>

  <li>
    Maintain consistency by not removing tabs when their function is unavailable. Instead offer an
    explanation as to why a tab’s content is unavailable and present the user with an action to
    remedy it
  </li>

  <li>Always arrange tabs in an order that makes sense for the user</li>
</ul>

<h4>Behaviors</h4>

<h6>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Try to organize tabs so that the most relevant, pre-selected tab is also the leftmost tab</li>

  <li>When clicked, tabs should transition between views and highlight the selected tab</li>

  <li>Disabled tabs should have a reduced opacity, not have hover styles, and be unclickable</li>

  <li>
    Tab content should not disrupt the overall page layout in ways that negatively impact user
    experience
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Editorial</h4>

<h6>Voice and tone, advice covering copy and images flowing into each element</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Tab labels should be in all uppercase</li>

  <li>Avoid tab labels that contain more than 2 words</li>

  <li>Avoid truncating tab labels</li>
</ul>
