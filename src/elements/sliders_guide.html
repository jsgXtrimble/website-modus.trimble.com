<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h4>Use when</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Encouraging user exploration when setting a value or range of values,
    especially when that value has an immediate effect on a data visualization.
  </li>

  <li>A series of options are presented using a stepped slider.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Don’t use when</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Gathering information in a form, i.e., <em>Age</em> or <em>Salary</em>. Instead, use a
    Form Text Box.
  </li>

  <li>You don’t include an input box and need a precise amount.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Language</h3>
<h6>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Always be used with a label, even if that label is hidden.</li>

  <li>
    When a label is visible, it should clearly communicate the purpose of the
    range input and its values (min, max, step, value)
  </li>

  <li>
    Be labeled as <em>Optional</em> when you need to request input that’s not required
  </li>

  <li>
    Validate input as soon as merchants have finished interacting with a field
    (but not before)
  </li>

  <li>
    Always be used with two text field components when range slider has dual
    thumbs, to provide accessible alternatives to both the lower and upper
    thumbs
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Behaviors</h3>
<h6>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    Adjust a slider’s value(s) by clicking and dragging its handle(s), or by
    clicking anywhere on its bar.
  </li>

  <li>
    Hovering over an active slider’s handle will change the default cursor to
    the grab cursor; clicking will change to the grabbing cursor.
  </li>
