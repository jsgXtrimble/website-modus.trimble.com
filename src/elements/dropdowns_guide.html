<h3>Guidelines:
</h3>

<h4>Use when
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Use the dropdown component to filter or sort content on a page.
  </li>



  <h4>Don’t use when
  </h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Providing more than 10 options.
    </li>

    <li>Providing only two options. Instead, use a Radio Group or a Switch.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h4>Visual language
  </h4>

  <h6>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more
  </h6>


  <p>Lookup select is ideal for lists with more than 15 items, but be careful not to overdo it.
  </p>


  <p><img src="cid:Image_0.png" />
    <img src="cid:Image_1.png" />
  </p>

  <p>Do:make the list a reasonable size for users to filter Don't: give them thousands of items to choose from.
  </p>


  <h4>Behaviors
  </h4>

  <h6>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions
  </h6>


  <ul>
    <li>Make sure the items in the list are in logical order (alphabetical, chronological, order of importance, etc.)
    </li>

    <li>If no item is preselected, use something like “Select a vendor” or “Select an account” in ghost or hint text
      format. If you can’t gray out the text, you can use some kind of indicator, like parentheses.
    </li>

    <li>If you need to, you can display ”None” as one of the options. It should have the same text formatting as the
      other options in the list.
    </li>
  </ul>



  <h4>Editorial
  </h4>

  <h6>Voice and tone, advice covering copy and images flowing into each element
  </h6>


  <ul>
    <li>Present drop-down selections in sentence case (“Select an account”). If the drop-down list contains formal
      names, such as customer names or accounts, then those selections will appear in title case.
    </li>

    <li>Don’t use “deselect.” Instead, use “clear.” The term “deselect” causes a problem for localization.
    </li>

    <li>The list of options should be sorted in a consistent order (alphabetical, chronological, the most selected
      option, or by order of importance).
    </li>

    <li>Don’t end text in a select with a period.
    </li>

    <li>Keep option names as brief as possible - aim for under 5 words.
    </li>
  </ul>
