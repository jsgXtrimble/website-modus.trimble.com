#### Variation 2

#### Variation 3

### Guidelines

#### Use when

*Combining a set of content with expand and collapse functionality.
*Allowing a user to hide controls and content so they can better focus on their task.

#### Don’t use when

*Providing an introductory element to a set of content which doesn’t need expand and collapse functionality. Instead, use a Header.
  Creating a set of visibly contained content which doesn’t need expand and collapse functionality. Instead, use a Module Container.

#### Visual language

*The arrow icon acts as an affordance to indicate the functionality of the accordion, as well as a visual marker of the state of the accordion through its rotation and direction.
*When stacking multiple accordions, use stack space constants to add margin-bottom to the block element.

#### Behaviors

*When an accordion expands and collapses only its height should change, its width should stay consistent.
*Expand and collapse functionality should never be triggered on hover.
*The expand and collapse functionality of an accordion is tied to the entire header of the component, with additional actions being triggered only by interaction within the bounds of their related UI components.

#### Editorial

*Keep titles to five words, if possible, to avoid wrapping.
*Use title case and capitalize prepositions of four letters or more.
