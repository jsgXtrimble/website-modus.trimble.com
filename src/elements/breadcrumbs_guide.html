<h3>Guidelines: 
</h3>

<h4>Use when
</h4>

<ul><li>When you need to inform the user of where they are.
</li>

<li>When the user may need to navigate back to a higher level.
</li>

<li>When the application has multi-layer architecture.
</li></ul>


<h4>Don’t use when
</h4>

<ul><li>Employing a vertical model tree component. 
</li>

<li>If a lower-level page is (or can be put) in more than one parent category, breadcrumb trails become ineffective, inaccurate and will confuse the user.
</li></ul>


<h4>Visual language
</h4>

<h6>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more
</h6>


<ul><li>All links in a breadcrumb should be clickable.
</li>

<li>Breadcrumbs are placed in horizontal form
</li>

<li>Breadcrumb trails are displayed in the top half of the page, below the primary navigation menu if a horizontal menu layout is used.
</li>

<li>The commonly accepted and most recognizable symbol for separating hyperlinks in breadcrumb trails is the “greater than” symbol (>). Typically, the > sign is used to denote hierarchy, as in the format of Parent category > Child category.
</li></ul>


<table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_0.png" />
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


<h4>Behaviors
</h4>

<h6>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions
</h6>


<ul><li>For implementations with large numbers of sub-directories, make use of ellipses and drop downs as shown in the example below 
</li>



<table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_1.png" />
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td></td>
</tr>
</table>


<h4>Editorial
</h4>

<h6>Voice and tone, advice covering copy and images flowing into each element
</h6>


<ul><li>Editorial will be provided by the hierarchy in a location based breadcrumb.
</li>

<li>Editorial for path-based breadcrumbs are always dynamically generated by the steps taken in a workflow.
</li></ul>
