<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Use when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use Cards when you need to group information in a digestible form.</li>

  <li>
    Use Cards when you need to offer a short entry point that is linked to more detailed content or
    a complex task.
  </li>

  <li>
    Use Cards to lay out single or multiple sets of related information in the same region of the
    page. Cards may include an image, a text summary, pills, and actions. Cards typically have
    similar widths, but heights should accommodate varying content.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Donâ€™t use when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    When you need to show unrelated content types or actions in a single container.
  </li>

  <li>When you need to show content in multiple columns.</li>

  <li>When you need to display content in a table format.</li>

  <li>
    Grouping a large set of related information, instead, use a Module Container.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Language</h3>
<h5>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Card dimensions are based on its content and the container in which it resides.
  </li>

  <li>Apply custom heights and width to meet product requirements.</li>

  <li>
    When creating a group of cards which feature the Supplemental Content element, use consistently
    sized content across the entire group in order to drive consistency.
  </li>
</ul>

<table class="table table-bordered bg-white">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="do"><strong class="text-success">Do</strong> keep cards consistent for easy scanning.</td>
    <td class="dont">

    </td>
  </tr>

<h3>Behaviors</h3>
<h5>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h5>
