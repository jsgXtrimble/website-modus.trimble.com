<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<h4>Use when</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Use Cards when you need to group information in a digestible form.</li>

  <li>
    Use Cards when you need to offer a short entry point that is linked to more
    detailed content or a complex task.
  </li>

  <li>
    Use Cards to lay out single or multiple sets of related information in the
    same region of the page. Cards may include an image, a text summary, pills,
    and actions. Cards typically have similar widths, but heights should
    accommodate varying content.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Donâ€™t use when</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    When you need to show unrelated content types or actions in a single
    container.
  </li>

  <li>When you need to show content in multiple columns.</li>

  <li>When you need to display content in a table format.</li>

  <li>
    Grouping a large set of related information, instead, use a Module
    Container.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Visual language</h4>

<h6>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    Card dimensions are based on its content and the container in which it
    resides.
  </li>

  <li>Apply custom heights and width to meet product requirements.</li>

  <li>
    When creating a group of cards which feature the Supplemental Content
    element, use consistently sized content across the entire group in order to
    drive consistency.
  </li>
</ul>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><img src="${require(`../img/guide/Card_03.png`)}" /></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><img src="${require(`../img/guide/Card_04.png`)}" /></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Do keep cards consistent for easy scanning.</p></td>
    <td>
      <p>Don't organize content in different ways when grouped together.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Behaviors</h4>

<h6>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    Cards should only contain a single action, which is tied to a UI component
    within the action element or to the whole card (using a card as a link).
  </li>
