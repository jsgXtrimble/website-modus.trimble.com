<h3>Guidelines
</h3>

<h4>Use when
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Affording a binary selection, like accepting terms and conditions.
  </li>

  <li>Affording multiple selections from a set of options.
  </li>

  <li>Enabling selection of an object, such as a Card.
  </li>

  <li>Affording selection of a row within a Data Table.
  </li>

  <li>If you use only one checkbox, it is the same as using Switch to toggle between two states. The difference is that
    Switch will trigger the state change directly, but Checkbox just marks the state as changed and this needs to be
    submitted.
  </li>
</ul>


<h4>Don’t use when
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Turning a feature, mode, or functionality on and off. Instead, use a Switch.
  </li>

  <li>Checking or unchecking elicits an immediate change in the UI or functionality, such as enabling a disabled field
    or revealing more controls. Instead, use a Switch.
  </li>

  <li>Checking or unchecking elicits a change in background functionality without affecting the UI, like disabling an
    email notification. Instead, use a Switch.
  </li>
</ul>

  <h5>Check box labels may be capitalized in 2 ways, depending on their length and placement on the UI:
  </h5>


  <ul>
    <li>Use title case for short labels (fewer than 3 words) that are to the left or above a check box.
    </li>

    <li>Use sentence case for longer labels (more than 3 words) that are placed to the right of a check box, especially
      if the label reads like a phrase.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h5>Default
  </h5>


  <ul>
    <li>Use full sentences with punctuation.
    </li>

    <li>If user is consenting to something, start the sentence with “I”, and also run the phrasing you choose by
      compliance.
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h5>Groups
  </h5>


  <ul>
    <li>Use full sentences with punctuation for the checkbox group label.
