<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Checkboxes vs Switches</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Checkboxes should be used in forms that require submission and processing.
  </li>

  <li>
    Switches are intended for instantaneous actions, such as toggling a
    feature/functionality within an app.
  </li>

  <li>
    Switches can either immediately affect the UI or affect changes in
    background behavior.
  </li>

  <li>
    If you use only one checkbox, it is the same as using a Switch to toggle
    between two states. The difference is that a Switch will trigger the state
    change directly, but a Checkbox just marks the state as changed and needs to
    be submitted.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Use checkboxes when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Affording a binary selection, like accepting terms and conditions.
  </li>

  <li>
    Affording multiple selections from a set of options.
  </li>

  <li>
    Enabling selection of an object, such as a Card.
  </li>

  <li>
    Affording selection of a row within a Data Table.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Don’t use checkboxes when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Turning a feature, mode, or functionality on and off. Instead, use a Switch.
  </li>

  <li>
    Checking or unchecking elicits an immediate change in the UI or
    functionality, such as enabling a disabled field or revealing more controls.
    Instead, use a Switch.
  </li>

  <li>
    Checking or unchecking elicits a change in background functionality without
    affecting the UI, like disabling an email notification. Instead, use a
    Switch.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Use switches when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
      Turning on and off a feature, mode, or functionality.
  </li>

  <li>
      Toggling elicits an immediate change in the UI.
  </li>

  <li>
      Toggling elicits a change in background behavior without affecting the UI.
  </li>

  <li>
      The difference between Switch and Checkbox is that Switch will trigger a state change directly when you toggle it, while Checkbox is generally used for state marking, which should work in conjunction with submit operation.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Don’t use switches when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
      Requiring user action consent, such as accepting terms and conditions. Instead, use a Form checkbox.
  </li>

  <li>
      Requesting multiple choices from a group of options. Instead, use a Form checkbox group.
  </li>

  <li>
      Users need to select one item from a list of options. Instead, use a radio button
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual language</h3>

<h5>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Checkboxes use the same <code>:hover</code> and <code>:active</code> styles as the
    primary Button when checked.
  </li>

  <li>
      A Switch must have a visible label that clearly conveys what option a user will turn on or off.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Behaviors</h3>
<h5>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Reflects the affirmative (“yes” or “true”) of its label when checked.
  </li>

  <li>
    Choices made via checkbox should always be submitted or saved using a
    Button.
  </li>

  <li>
    A checkbox’s label is included in the clickable target area.
  </li>

  <li>
    The default view of a set of checkboxes is having no option selected.
  </li>

  <li>
    Avoid changing the label text based on <em>on</em> and <em>off</em> state.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Check box labels may be capitalized in 2 ways, depending on their length and
    placement on the UI:
  </li>

  <li>
    Use title case for short labels (fewer than 3 words) that are to the left or
    above a check box.
  </li>

  <li>
    Use sentence case for longer labels (more than 3 words) that are placed to
    the right of a check box, especially if the label reads like a phrase.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Default</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use full sentences with punctuation.
  </li>

  <li>
    If user is consenting to something, start the sentence with “I”, and also
    run the phrasing you choose by compliance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Groups</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use full sentences with punctuation for the checkbox group label.
  </li>

  <li>
    Try to keep checkbox labels brief and start them with verbs.
  </li>
</ul>
