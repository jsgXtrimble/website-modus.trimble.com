<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<h3>Use when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Affording a binary selection, like accepting terms and conditions.</li>

  <li>Affording multiple selections from a set of options.</li>

  <li>Enabling selection of an object, such as a Card.</li>

  <li>Affording selection of a row within a Data Table.</li>

  <li>
    If you use only one checkbox, it is the same as using Switch to toggle
    between two states. The difference is that Switch will trigger the state
    change directly, but Checkbox just marks the state as changed and this needs
    to be submitted.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Don’t use when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Turning a feature, mode, or functionality on and off. Instead, use a Switch.
  </li>

  <li>
    Checking or unchecking elicits an immediate change in the UI or
    functionality, such as enabling a disabled field or revealing more controls.
    Instead, use a Switch.
  </li>

  <li>
    Checking or unchecking elicits a change in background functionality without
    affecting the UI, like disabling an email notification. Instead, use a
    Switch.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual language</h3>

<h5>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Uses the same :hover and :active styles as the primary Button when checked.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Behaviors</h3>
<h5>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Reflects the affirmative (“yes” or “true”) of its label when checked.
  </li>

  <li>
    Choices made via checkbox should always be submitted or saved using a
    Button.
  </li>

  <li>A checkbox’s label is included in the clickable target area.</li>

  <li>
    The default view of a set of checkboxes is having no option selected.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>
  Check box labels may be capitalized in 2 ways, depending on their length and
  placement on the UI:
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use title case for short labels (fewer than 3 words) that are to the left or
    above a check box.
  </li>

  <li>
    Use sentence case for longer labels (more than 3 words) that are placed to
    the right of a check box, especially if the label reads like a phrase.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Default</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Use full sentences with punctuation.</li>

  <li>
    If user is consenting to something, start the sentence with “I”, and also
    run the phrasing you choose by compliance.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Groups</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Use full sentences with punctuation for the checkbox group label.</li>

  <li>Try to keep checkbox labels brief and start them with verbs.</li>
</ul>
