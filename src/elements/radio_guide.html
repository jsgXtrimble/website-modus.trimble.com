<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h4>Use when
</h4>

<ul><li>When visibility and quick response is a priority.
</li>

<li>When comparison of options needs to be clear.
</li>

<li>When you want to emphasize options.
</li></ul>


<h4>Don’t use when
</h4>

<ul><li>You are providing more than 7 options.
</li>

<li>You are attempting to highlight a preferred choice. (Use a dropdown)
</li>

<li>When a large number of familiar options are available.
</li></ul>


<h4>Visual language
</h4>

<h6>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more
</h6>


<ul><li>When possible, use the stacked variation. Options are harder to differentiate within the horizontal group.
</li>



<table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_0.png" />
</p>
</td>
<td><p><img src="cid:Image_1.png" />
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><p><strong>Do</strong> stack options for clear visual scanning
</p>
</td>
<td><p><strong>Don’t</strong> span horizontally as it is more difficult to scan
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>


<ul><li>Uses the same :hover and :active styles as the primary Button.
</li>


<h4>Behaviors
</h4>

<h6>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions
</h6>


<ul><li>A set of radio buttons should default to having one option selected. Never display them without a default selection.
</li>

<li>If selecting no option is a viable choice, include a radio button within the group with an appropriate label, i.e. “None”.
</li>

<li>Generally, the first option in the radio group should be selected by default. If preselection of an option can result in incorrect assumptions, i.e., “Male” or “Female”, then no option should be selected by default.
</li>

<li>A radio button’s label is part of the clickable area of the control.
</li></ul>


<h4>Editorial
</h4>

<h6>Voice and tone, advice covering copy and images flowing into each element
</h6>


<ul><li>If necessary, a heading can accompany a set of radio buttons to provide further clarity for the user. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized).
</li>

<li>Always use a clear and concise label for radio buttons. Be explicit about the action that will follow if the radio button is selected. Labels appear to the right of radio buttons. Use sentence-style capitalization (only the first word in a phrase and any proper nouns capitalized) and no more than three words.
</li></ul>
