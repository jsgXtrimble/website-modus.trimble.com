<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h3>When to Use</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    To reduce a user's uncertainty. Reassure the use that your app is working.
  </li>

  <li>
    To reduce the user's perception of time and offer them a reason to wait.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>When NOT to Use</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Inside of smaller elements, such as buttons, chips, or badges.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual language</h3>
<h5>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    A progress indicator is represented by a gray bar that is filled with color
    over time as loading occurs.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="guide-example-block">
  <div class="guide-sample">
    <div class="progress">
      <div
        id="progressExample"
        class="progress-bar"
        role="progressbar"
        style="width: 0;"
        aria-valuenow="25"
        aria-valuemin="0"
        aria-valuemax="100"
      ></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Behaviors</h3>
<h5>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    A progress indicator should fill up to completion as background loading
    tasks are complete.
  </li>

  <li>
    Whenever possible, show the user a textual representation of their progress
    that corresponds to the loading indicator.
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="guide-example-block">
  <div class="guide-sample text-center text-primary">
    <div class="progress">
      <div
        class="progress-bar"
        role="progressbar"
        style="width: 75%;"
        aria-valuenow="75"
        aria-valuemin="0"
        aria-valuemax="100"
      ></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text-left text-dark">
      <strong>Completed 30 of 40. </strong>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h5>
  Voice and tone, advice covering copy and images flowing into each element
</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Progress indicators generally have negative connotations among users. Use
    them sparingly. Focus on optimizing loading rather than growing dependant on
    using progress indicators.
  </li>
</ul>
