<h2>Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Use when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Providing supplemental tasks required by the underlying page.</li>

  <li>Providing non-essential information related to the underlying page.</li>

  <li>Content requires full attention.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Don’t use when</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    Requesting a simple action, like saving changes. Instead, use a Dialog.
  </li>

  <li>
    Conveying brief thoughts or status changes. Instead, use a Notification.
  </li>

  <li>
    The modal content can be incorporated into the underlying page without
    complicating the page’s intent.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Visual Language</h3>
<h5>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h5>

<h4>Modals consist of three elements:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Header, which holds the title and controls.</li>

  <li>Content area, which holds the information being presented.</li>

  <li>
    Page overlay, which partially blocks out the underlying page to focus
    attention on the modal content.
  </li>

  <li>
    Controls, which are usually Buttons, are always placed on the bottom right
    side of the modal header.
  </li>

  <li>
    Place icon-only buttons to the left of standard primary and secondary
    buttons.
  </li>

  <li>
    When placing text in the content area element, define typography as custom
    styles within your product. The modal’s content area does not include any
    default text styling.
  </li>

  <li>
    Consider applying a custom z-index value when you compose this component
    with other layered components (e.g., Dialogs, Tooltips, or Notifications) to
    meet your product requirements.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Behaviors</h3>
<h5>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Action-required modals can only be closed by choosing an action provided
    (e.g., Save or Cancel). They cannot be dismissed by pressing escape or
    clicking outside of the modal.
  </li>

  <li>
    Modals that do not require an explicit action of a user can be closed by:
  </li>

  <li>Clicking the close button</li>

  <li>Pressing the escape key</li>

  <li>Clicking outside the modal</li>

  <li>
    Once a modal reaches its maximum height, the header will remain fixed and
    content will scroll within the container.
  </li>

  <li>Modals are centered horizontally and vertically in the viewport.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Editorial</h3>
<h5>
  Voice and tone, advice covering copy and images flowing into each element
</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use title case for titles. (This means capitalize prepositions and
    conjunctions of four or more letters and all primary words.)
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Dismissable Modals</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Titles should tell you what’s inside the modal. Consider using words from
    the link that launched the modal. Titles can also be questions.
  </li>

  <li>
    Content can scroll in the modal if need be, but the shorter, the better.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Action-is-Required Modals</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Titles should tell the user what they need to do. Consider starting with
    words from the link that launched the modal, and add other words to express
    a complete thought. Avoid questions.
  </li>

  <li>
    Content should tell users why they’re doing something, how to do it, and the
    consequences of not doing it, if applicable.
  </li>

  <li>
    Content can scroll in the modal if need be, but the shorter, the better.
  </li>
</ul>
