<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<h4>Use when</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use when some content can be hidden because it is not critical to the user’s
    task.
  </li>

  <li>You want to declutter the interface.</li>

  <li>You want to simplify a complex process.</li>

  <li>There are options dependent upon a prior selection.</li>

  <li>All options and information are not critical to see at first.</li>

  <li>
    Allowing a user to hide controls and content so they can better focus on
    their task.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Don’t use when</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    Providing an introductory element to a set of content which doesn’t need an
    expand and collapse functionality. Instead, use a Header.
  </li>

  <li>Hide critical content solely to clean up the interface.</li>

  <li>Hide an action if the user can easily do it without additional input.</li>

  <li>Hide primary actions on the page.</li>

  <li>Reveal content that is not contextually relevant to the user’s input.</li>

  <li>
    Nest too many layers. In other words, don’t place accordions within
    accordions.
  </li>

  <li>
    Creating a set of visibly contained content which doesn’t need an expand and
    collapse functionality. Instead, use a Module Container.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Visual language</h4>

<h6>To inform judgment about color, type, space, and more</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    The arrow icon acts as an affordance to indicate the functionality of the
    accordion, as well as a visual marker of the state of the accordion through
    its rotation and direction.
  </li>

  <li>
    When stacking multiple accordions, use stack space constants to add
    margin-bottom to the block element.
  </li>
</ul>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><img src="${require(`../img/guide/Accordian_1.svg`)}" /></p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p><img src="${require(`../img/guide/Accordian_2.svg`)}" /></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p>
        <strong>Do </strong>use the without border variation to omit the border
        from the first accordion in a stack when it may conflict with other
        visual elements, like a Module Container.
      </p>
    </td>
    <td>
      <p>
        <strong>Don’t </strong>use an unnecessary border to avoid visual noise.
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Behaviors</h4>

<h6>To cover how to cope with events, outcomes, and transitions</h6>

<ul>
  <li>
    When an accordion expands and collapses only its height should change, its
    width should stay consistent.
  </li>

  <li>Expand and collapse functionality should never be triggered on hover</li>

  <li>
    The expand and collapse functionality of an accordion is tied to the entire
    header of the component, with additional actions being triggered only by
    interaction within the bounds of their related UI components.
  </li>

  <li>
    Avoid “nested” accordions—that is, collapsible content within collapsible
    content. This type of pattern goes against UX best practices.
  </li>
</ul>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <p><img src="${require(`../img/guide/Accordian_3.svg`)}" /></p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><p>Interactive areas within an accordion.</p></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4>Editorial</h4>

<h6>
  Voice and tone, advice covering copy and images flowing into each element
</h6>

<ul>
  <li>Keep titles to five words, if possible, to avoid wrapping.</li>

  <li>Use title case and capitalize prepositions of four letters or more.</li>
</ul>
