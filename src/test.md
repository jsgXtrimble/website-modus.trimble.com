## **Background and Strategic Fit**

Our European sister company, Trimble Transport & Logistics (Trimble TL) has been using third party services from PTV Group xServer for their mapping needs and their contract is due to end by this December. Trimble TL has requested Trimble MAPS to offer functionality similar to PTV_TruckAttributes feature layer which provides their map visualization of restrictions on route segments. Road restrictions are displayed as different icons on the map and the icon sizes are adjusted according to the map zoom levels. 

To support Trimble TL’s needs, Trimble MAPS has to offer a new map layer called “Truck Restrictions” which will display road restrictions as icons on the map. The various restrictions that can be considered to display on the map include but are not limited to: 



*   Drive restrictions such as No Trucks Allowed, No Cars Allowed, Delivery Trucks Only
*   Dimension restrictions such as Height, Weight, Width, Length, Max axles, Has Trailer
*   Hazmat and Tunnel restrictions 

Truck Attributes Layer will be available to our licensed map customers through a separate, new paid add-on that can be added to an API Key.
