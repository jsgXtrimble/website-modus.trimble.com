  <p>Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The Modus kit contains all assets you need to get started.
  </p>
  
  
  <h3>Start by obtaining the kit
  </h3>
  
  
  <h3>1. Install Sketch.
  </h3>
  
  <ul><li>To design with Carbon you must have the most recent version of <u>Sketch</u> installed.
  </li>
  
  
  
  <h3>2. Get the library.
  </h3>
  
  <ul><li>To obtain the Modus Design System library, go to this <u>link</u>.
  </li>
  
  
  
  <table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_0.png" />
  </p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  <h6>Click on the “Add library to Sketch” button in the lower right of the screen.
  </h6>
  
  
  <h3>3. Add the library
  </h3>
  
  
  <table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_1.png" />
  </p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  <h6>Click on the “Add library to Sketch” button in the lower right of the modal.
  </h6>
  
  
  
  <h3>4. The library is now added to your Preferences -> Libraries list.
  </h3>
  
  
  
  <table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_2.png" />
  </p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  <h6>Great job! You are now ready to start assembling UI’s!
  </h6>
  
  
  
  <h3>Symbols
  </h3>
  
  <h5>Modus components, live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.
  </h5>
  
  
  <table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_3.png" />
  </p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  <h4>Library menu navigation
  </h4>
  
  
  <ul><li>There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.
  </li>
  
  <li>From the Insert menu, select Symbols → Modus Design System to add symbols onto your page.
  </li>
  
  <li>Modus symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.
  </li></ul>
  
  
  <h4>Structure
  </h4>
  
  <h5>Symbols are organized by component; after selecting a component, you’ll see the variations and states of that component.
  </h5>
  
  
  <ul><li>To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your artboard.
  </li>
  
  <li>For even more configurability, use the individual building blocks found under the Items folder within the symbol where available. Be sure your custom design adheres to our design guidelines.
  </li></ul>
  
  
  <h3>Text styles
  </h3>
  
  <h5>Text styles are based on typography rules defined by the Modus Design System.
  </h5>
  
  
  <table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_4.png" />
  </p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  
  <h4>Library menu navigation
  </h4>
  
  
  <ul><li>From the main menu select Insert → Text Styles → Modus Design System to insert a Modus type token text style.
  </li>
  
  <li>Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.
  </li></ul>
  
  
  <h4>Structure
  </h4>
  
  <h5>Modus text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.
  </h5>
  
  
  
  <h3>Layer styles
  </h3>
  
  <h5>Layer styles are color selections for any shape in Sketch.
  </h5>
  
  
  <table><tr><td><p><img src="cid:Image_5.png" />
  </p>
  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  <h6>Use predetermined overrides when possible
  </h6>
  
  
  
  <h4>Library menu navigation
  </h4>
  
  
  <ul><li>Color in Modus is carefully considered, and we discourage custom layer styles
  </li>
  
  
  <h3>Info
  </h3>
  
  
  <ul><li>If you’re brand new to Sketch, they offer some great <u>tutorials and help docs</u>.
  </li>
  
  
  <h3>Updates
  </h3>
  
  
  <ul><li>We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window.
  </li>
  
  <li>The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.
  </li></ul>
