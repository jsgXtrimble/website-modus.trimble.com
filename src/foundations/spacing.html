        Use the spacing scale when building individual components. It includes small increments
        needed to create appropriate spatial relationships for detail-level designs. This scale is
        applied and used within all components.

      <h3>Layout scale</h3>

      <p>
        The layout scale is used for arranging components and other UI parts into a full page
        layout. It has larger increments that are used to control the density of a design. Use the
        smaller layout tokens to create more dense compositions and direct relationships. Use the
        larger tokens to increase the amount of white space and to disassociate sections.

      <h3>Using layout scale with the grid</h3>

      <p>
        The grid is the encouraged way to horizontally space UI elements. The layout scale is most
        commonly used for vertical spacing, but it can also be applied for horizontal spacing when
        appropriate, especially in the case of fixed spacing.
      </p>

      <h3>Designing with space</h3>

      <p>
        Every part of a UI should be intentional including the empty space between elements. The
        amount of space between items creates relationships and hierarchy.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating relationships</h3>

      <p>
        Elements in a design that are near each other are seen as being meaningfully related. As
        more space is added between elements, their perceived relationship weakens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Patterns created through spacing can also create relationships. Elements arranged in the
        same spacing pattern are seen as related pieces that have equal weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Space can also be used to denote groups of associated information. This creates content
        sections on a page without having to use lines or other graphical elements as a divider.
      </p>

      <h3>Creating hierarchy</h3>

      <p>
        Elements that have more spacing around them tend to be perceived as higher in importance
        than elements that have less space around them. Take this page for instance. The top level
        headers have more space surrounding them giving them focus and prominence. Then as the
        headers descend in importance they receive less space, signaling they are subordinate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Elements that are set close to each other can be easily overlooked. Users may see the
        grouping but not process each individual item. Therefore, if you have an element or content
        of high importance on the page, consider giving it extra surrounding space to help it
        attract focus.
      </p>

      <h3>White space</h3>

      <p>
        Empty space — also known as white space — is important in design. It can be used to break up
        sections on a page or to help create focus on certain element(s). White space helps with
        information processing; too much dense information can be disorienting or overwhelming for a
        user. Sections of a UI are allowed to be dense, but the whole page should not be crowded;
        there should be white space to let the user’s eye rest.
