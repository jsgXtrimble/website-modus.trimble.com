## Floating Action Buttons

Floating action buttons (FABs) are used for the primary or most common, action on a screen.  They appear at the highest level "floating" above screen content thus they include a dropshadow to evoke a sense of depth. Circular & pill shapes are often used for these buttons. Recommended sizes are 56px and 48px. Secondary color may also be used if necessary.
