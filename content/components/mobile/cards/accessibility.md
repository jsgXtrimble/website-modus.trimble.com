## Accessibility

- Cards should use an underlying `article` element to maintain usability for some screen reader users.
- Although the card element passes accessibility testing, content authors need to ensure the content within the card is accessible. For example, if you add an image to the card you need to include alternative text to pass accessibility testing.
