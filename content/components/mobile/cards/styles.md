### Styles

Card layouts may vary to support the content within. The dimensions of a card will depend on the implementation of the card and as well as it's content and use case. Apply custom heights and width to meet product requirements.

# Layout Examples

{{< img src="/img/mobile/card-padding.svg" dark="/img/mobile/card-padding-dark.svg" width="961" height="170" class="w-100" alt="Card Padding" loading="auto" >}}

{{< img src="/img/mobile/card-variation.svg" dark="/img/mobile/card-variation-dark.svg" width="961" height="170" class="w-100" alt="Card Variation" loading="auto" >}}

## Card States

Cards can have a default, focus, and selected state. Selected states are optional and should be implemented based on use case. Mobile cards do not have a hover state.

## Behavior & Interactions

Cards can have the following transitions and interactions:
- Cards themselves can be clickable
- Expand/Collapse
- Cards can be dragged
