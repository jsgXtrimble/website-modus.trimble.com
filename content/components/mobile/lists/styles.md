### Styles

## Types

Accordions come in two sizes to accommodate space availability on the page or within a [Card](/components/mobile/cards/). Default size should be used when accordions display directly in the main content container on the page. Compact size is useful, when the accordion displays within a smaller container (e.g. card) or smaller section of the page.

### Contained Accordion
