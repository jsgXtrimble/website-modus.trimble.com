## Overview

List includes atomic components List Item, Icon, Label, Control.

## Usage

**Use when**

- Some content can be hidden because it is not critical to the user’s task.
- You want to declutter the interface or shorten pages to reduce scrolling when content is not crucial to read in full.
- You want to simplify a complex process.
- There are options dependent upon a prior selection.
- All options and information are not critical to see at first.
- Allowing users to hide controls and content, so they can better focus on their task.

**Don’t use when**

- Providing an introductory element to a set of content which doesn’t need an expand and collapse functionality. Instead, use a [Navbar](/componets/mobile/navbars/).
- Hiding critical content solely to clean up the interface.
- Hiding an action if the user can easily do it without additional input.
- Hiding primary actions on the page.
- Revealing content that is not contextually relevant to the user.
- Nesting too many layers. In other words, don’t place accordions within accordions.
- Creating a set of visibly contained content, which doesn’t need an expand-and-collapse functionality. Instead, use a [Card](/components/mobile/cards/).
