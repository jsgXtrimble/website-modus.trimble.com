## Behaviors

- A set of radio buttons should default to having one option selected, generally the first option. However, if pre-selection of an option results in incorrect assumptions (i.e., “Male” or “Female”) then no option should be selected by default.
- If selecting no option is a viable choice, include a radio button within the group with an appropriate label, i.e. “None”.
- A radio button’s label is part of the clickable area of the control.
