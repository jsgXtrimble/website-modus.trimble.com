## Overview

The side navigation of an application provides context through accessible menu options and positions a consistent component to connect to various pages in the application.

The side navigation is a collapsible side content of the site’s pages. It sits alongside the page’s primary content. The component is designed to add side content to a fullscreen application.

## Usage

**Use when**

- You need to navigate between multiple pages.
- Navigating between static content.

**Don't use when**

- Your application only has one feature and user can use the application to navigate between functionality
- You need to provide page-specific actions (such as Save, Edit, etc.). Use a Toolbar instead -- Coming soon!
- Navigational items need to be loaded
- You need to show a content tree. Use a [Content Tree](/components/content-tree/) instead.
- Items in the side nav need to open dialogs.
- You’re designing for a mobile application - use the mobile specific side navigation (Coming soon!)

Note: there are other types of navigation that can be used along with the Side Nav:
Breadcrumbs
Headers
Tabs
Tree structure
