## Overview

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. They communicate calls-to-action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. Best practices recommend using button labels wherever possible to express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

## Usage

**Use when**

- The intent is to communicate actions users can take and allow users to interact with the page.
- Each page should have one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons

**Don't use when**

- Segmented controls or other form controls would work better.
