## Overview

Text inputs allow users to enter text into the user interface. They typically appear in forms, often with checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons.

## Usage

**Use when**

- Always have a label next to the text field, either above, on the left side or login in the input.
- Label text should always be visible.
- Display the validation state clearly. The validation message will replace Helper Text.
- Try to make Label text concise. Where it must be longer (due to language translation), the label text can wrap to a second line. Truncate label at end of second line if absolutely necessary.

**Don't use when**

- Don't add validation text under helper text, as their appearance will shift content.
- Donâ€™t design text fields to look similar to buttons, as they could be mistaken for buttons.
