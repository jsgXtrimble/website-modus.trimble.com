## Overview

Lists are used to present information in well-formed and organized way. The user can view or take action on list line items.

A list displays related content in a vertical format. A list is typically the focus of the screen and composes the main body of the screen layout. Lists are made of list items.

List items should be of a similar and obvious category of information (i.e., a list of 'design files,' or a list of 'point locations'). A list item contains at least a label and is a consistent format that helps the user to scan and read the content efficiently.

The List Order should be carefully considered. Examples of list orders include: most recently used first, date created, alphabetical, or numeric value. The user may also filter the list to show certain content. Use filters judiciously.

## Usage

**Use when**

- Use a list in the following cases:
  To display and interact with simple pieces of data in a consistent format in the main body of the screen.

**Don't use when**

- Don't add validation text under helper text, as their appearance will shift content.
- Donâ€™t use a list for displaying complex datasets: Consider using a table instead.
  Don't make lists of uncategorized information. Use groups of list items to organize similar content.

## Types

Their are two kinds of list standard and spaced. Spaced is for in-field experiences that need the extra room when reaching to press and no active the wrong list item.
