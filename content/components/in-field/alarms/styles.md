### Behaviors

All buttons (including icon buttons) should have the following states:

- Alarms indicate that a show-stopping condition existsâ€”the operator may NOT continue to work.
- The system is unable to function until the underlying issue is addressed. Unresolved alarms will also appear in the Alarms & Alerts message tray under the Bell icon in the Action bar.
- Unresolved alarms that are related to onboard devices, or other configuration errors will result in red Dashboard tiles.
- Unresolved alarms may also result in error messages in others of the software.

- **Persistent:** Yes.
- **Visibility:** Full Screen. Remains visible until acknowledged.
- **Actions:** Can have one button (e.g. OK) or two (rare).
- **Shade rest of screen:** N/A - alarm is a full screen message.
- **Audio:** One long continuous beep on entry.
- **Message Centre:** Recorded in the log. Active until resolved, badge number on bell.

#### Editorial

- Messages should be brief written in full sentences with proper punctuation.
- They should provide the user with helpful, contextual information about a possible action or a set of data.
