### Behaviors

- Within a segmented control, all segments are usually equal in width. Like buttons, segments can contain text or images. Segments can also have text labels beneath them (or beneath the control as a whole).
- In general, keep segment size consistent.

### Segments Controls Progression

All segments controls should have the following states:

- Default/Active
- Focus
- Disabled
