## Overview

Segmented controls allow users to make a single selection from a set of 2–5 options, as a common alternative to radio buttons and dropdown menus. They clearly present all available options to users and are easy to use on mobile devices and tablets.

## Usage

**Use when**

- Use a segmented control to provide closely related choices that affect an object, state, or view.
- Use them over other selection controls to reduce cognitive load.

**Don’t use when**

- Avoid using a segmented control to enable actions, such as adding, removing, or editing content.
- Do not use them to filter or navigate content (use [Tabs](/components/in-field/tabs/) instead).
- Avoid crowding the control with too many segments.
