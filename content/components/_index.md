## Web

Library of Modus components and building blocks for designing and developing cohesive, consistent, and responsive web-based applications and workflows. Components are available in various frameworks such as Modus Bootstrap, Modus React Bootstrap, and Web Components. Modus Web UI Kits are available in Figma and Adobe XD for designers.

## Mobile

The mobile library for native apps Modus components and elements for designing and developing consistent mobile applications and workflows. These components are available for native or cross-platform applications on iOS and Android devices. Modus Mobile UI Kits are available in Figma and Adobe XD for designers.

## In-Field

The in-field, high-contrast library is specific to applications used outdoors on handheld devices where the environmental conditions cannot be controlled. These applications are built to meet the users' special needs, such as challenging outdoor lighting, moving or vibrating devices, and/or impeding protective clothing. Modus In-Field UI Kits are available in Figma.

### In-Cab

A library of Modus components, building blocks, specifications, and principles to maintain a consistent experience when operating heavy machinery or vehicles in the field. In-cab is a more specialized subcategory of in-field patterns. It is primarily targeted towards large, easy-to-use, easy-to-identify, high-contrast components. These components are designed specifically for use on displays within a machine or a vehicle, mounted in a cab, vibrating and often at arm's-length. Because operation of the machine is the user's primary focus, the in-cab displays are used in the periphery of vision and need to have larger elements and rely heavily on iconography rather than text.

## XR

Library of building blocks for the creation of user experiences and application interactions for Mixed Reality (HoloLens 2) or Virtual Reality (Windows Mixed Reality Devices, HTC Vive, Oculus Quest 2). The common patterns for these two environments are based on MRTK and serve both platforms to optimize component use as well as offer consistent user experiences,
Use this library for the creation of workflow visualizations in Figma, rapid prototyping and application creation in Unity. Implement it for the creation of complementary 3D interfaces for immersive experiences. Don't use this library for the creation of AR experiences on tablet and mobile devices.

## Desktop

Desktop application patterns for software that can be installed on a single computer (laptop or desktop) used to perform specific tasks. _COMING SOON!_
