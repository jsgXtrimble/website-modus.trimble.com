## Introduction

Modus includes components and guidelines. It serves product managers, designers, and developers as a repository of everything they need to plan, prototype, and develop better products. It’s a living system and at its core are your contributions. Modus resources include

- [multi-platform](/about/), [accessible](/foundations/accessibility/) design patterns
- icons, font, and design guidelines
- cross-browser component markup

Early in 2017, Trimble design teams did an audit of all product offerings. What we discovered was a wide disparity of brand presentation product to product. It became evident that we needed to achieve visual consistency, focus more on UX and research, and increase efficiency in both design and implementation.

The main goal of the design system is to create a cohesive brand experience. It also aims at increased scalability, better management of debt, design consistency, rapid prototyping, quick iteration, and improved user experience. Modus establishes a shared vocabulary between designers and developers and provides guidelines for better branded user interfaces and development resources.

## Who Can Benefit

Product owners, designers, and developers are the primary audience for this system. The result of this alignment is consistency for the end-user.

- Designers have a library of components at their disposal.
- Designers have confidence that components are well tested.
- Developers have a rulebook to follow.
- Developers have access to the central library if their team lacks a dedicated designer.
- PMs can quickly put together prototypes using existing components.

## Governance

Modus is maintained and supported by product teams across Trimble. Although the system initially was created by a small, dedicated group, our mission is to have it open to the entire community where everyone is welcomed to contribute. Modus is managed and maintained by a core team and governed by the UX Council. The UX Council and the Trimble leadership encourage adoption of the design system, and the core team is dedicated to providing training and guidance for design and implementation.

## How to Contribute

Trimble Modus Design System is the result of community contributions, and we are constantly working to make it better. We welcome your feedback as well as contributions in the form of design patterns, code, ideas, articles, and user research.
