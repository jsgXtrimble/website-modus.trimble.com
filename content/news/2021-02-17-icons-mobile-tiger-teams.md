We are searching for contributors to join one of two Tiger Teams:

## Icon Implementation Tiger Team

Last year a great Tiger Team of talented UXers has worked on defining icons and icon usage. We now are looking for Tiger Team members to help us implement our standards, design a starter icon set, and brainstorm options to host the library for both designers and developers to use.

## Mobile Pattern Tiger Team

Is your product available on a mobile device? Are you looking for mobile patterns in Modus? Join our Tiger Team to help add patterns specific to mobile devices and small screens.

Joining is easy! Volunteer by filling out the form below by **March 3, 2021**. [Learn more about the Tiger Team process](/community/tiger-teams/).
