The Modus Delivery Team is collecting insights from Modus Web Figma analytics. In order to better understand the quantitative data from Figma analytics, we need to gather some qualitative user feedback.

How do you use the Modus Figma UI Kit in your designs? What components are most important to you? What do you detach? How can we improve the Figma UI Kit, so you can detach less?  What components or variants are we missing? Please fill out the survey quick survey. If you want to tell us more, leave your contact information so we can schedule a short interview.
