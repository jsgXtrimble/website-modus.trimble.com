Trimble offers many products and services. All Trimble products should offer help documentation as to the onboarding and usage of the software. Current Help menus often differ in order, naming conventions, and taxonomy causing confusion for users, hurting adoption, and wasting an opportunity to provide a unified experience on the most basic service level.

We are looking for new tiger team members to define how the help navigation works across all Trimble applications. The team will aim to provide a superset of Help options to users through designs and artifacts that support a cohesive and unified experience.

Joining is easy! Volunteer by filling out the form below by **February 25, 2022**. [Learn more about the Tiger Team process](/community/tiger-teams/).
