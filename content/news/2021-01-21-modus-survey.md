Now that Modus 1.0 has launched, we're eager to know whether and how you are using the design system and how we can make it even more useful to you. As a member of the Trimble UX, engineering, or product management community at Trimble, your feedback is crucial! Please, take a few minutes to take our **[survey](https://forms.gle/jxQ68GmFLxcK9TVf9)** by next **Friday, January 29**, so we can learn how to serve you better. Even if you don't currently use Modus, please take a minute to tell us that as well and provide us with a reason for why not.

Thank you for your participation and feedback!
