Dear Trimble UX Community,

We have two new patterns we would like to add to Modus: data visualization and transaction email template. Please, review the documentation and specifications for both and provide your feedback below by **Wednesday, May 12**.

## Data Visualization Guidelines

Are graphs or charts used in your product? Do you have experience with designing data visualization? What guidelines would you expect in Modus on how to represent quantitative and categorical data?

- [Data Visualization Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UzjgemAZBFogV7Sfly93ODpsQDxdX45ZJu53NJgHkSg/edit?usp=sharing)

## Transactional Emails

Does the application you are working on send out transactional emails? Do you currently have emails that are triggered by user actions?

- [Transactional Email Pattern](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MJB2HUxafWV0g58cWr-cRnDJoZue_6dbkn-Tz01qbhg/edit?usp=sharing)

You may review one or both of these proposals. When reviewing the documentation, take under consideration the needs of your product as well as other products at Trimble. Some questions you may want to ask during your review:

- Is this pattern going to work for my product?
- Does my product have a specific need or functionality that this proposal does not cover?
- Are there any limitations in my product that might prevent me from successfully implementing this pattern?
- Is there anything else you would like us to think about?

Thank you so much for taking the time to review the proposed pattern and guidelines and for providing your feedback! We appreciate your time and contributions. Once we review the feedback from the community, we will make necessary revisions.
