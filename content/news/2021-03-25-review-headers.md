Dear Trimble UX Community,

The Header Tiger Team has proposed a pattern to be added to Modus. Please, review the documentation, specifications, and mockups and provide your feedback below by **Friday, April 2**.

- [App Header component guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hMxgAheI1X_pQsHOMs4JxMNAdZuUp5DiS3AlM2zybTw/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Figma artboard](https://www.figma.com/proto/bkciPyRAAJ8rTVcM8jQUYT/Modus-App-Header-Component-re-crafting-from-Sketch?node-id=7%3A109&viewport=726%2C144%2C0.25&scaling=min-zoom)

When reviewing the documentation, take under consideration the needs of your product as well as other products at Trimble. Some questions you may want to ask during your review:

- Is this header going to work for my product?
- Does my product have a specific need or functionality that this proposal does not cover?
- Are there any limitations in my product that might prevent me from successfully implementing this header?
- Is there anything else you would like us to think about?

Thank you so much for taking the time to review the proposed pattern and providing your feedback! We appreciate your time and contributions. Once we review the feedback from the community, we will make necessary revisions and the pattern will be added to Modus after the final approval of the UX Board.
