We are searching for contributors to join a new Tiger Teams to generate better guidance for some of our componets.

We have found that there are some usability issues with some of our components:

- Accordions are sometimes difficult for users to use because they very subtle and the expanding icon can be far from the title. There may also be particular use-cases that are not covered and that Modus does not offer as an option (e.g. warning or error states).
- The card and modal components are very vague and could use a little more guidanace and templates on the content positioned within.
- Tabs suffer from being too subtle and we have feedback that they are difficult for users to recognize.

If you are interested in solving usability problems and/or have interest in these components, please join the Tiger Team!
