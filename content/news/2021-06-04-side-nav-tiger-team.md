We are searching for contributors to outline, design, and add the side navigation panel pattern to Modus. The side navigation panel opens when the "hamburger menu" icon is clicked in the top navbar, an element we recently added to Modus.

Is there a need for a side navigation panel in your product? Does your product already have side navigation? Do you have creative ideas on how to handle side navigation? Have you worked on the top navbar component and would like to contribute further? Then you should join our Tiger Team!

Joining is easy! Volunteer by filling out the form below by **June 16, 2021**. [Learn more about the Tiger Team process](/community/tiger-teams/).
