Dear Trimble UX Community,

The Side Navigation Tiger Team has proposed guidelines for a new Modus component. Please, review the documentation, specifications, and mockups and provide your feedback below by **Thursday, December 2**.

- [Side Navigation component guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1093Kf33Mvv4wY--MH3dNZIknXFlLG9gvcMU_Qgxfn9s/edit#)

- [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/proto/9ErPt8WOPgn4yyvjJd2SVE/SIde-Nav?page-id=79%3A1377&node-id=79%3A1378&viewport=350%2C48%2C0.34&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=79%3A1378&show-proto-sidebar=1)

When reviewing the documentation, take under consideration the needs of your product as well as other products at Trimble. Some questions you may want to ask during your review:

- Are these side navigation options going to work for my product?
- Does my product have a specific need or functionality that this proposal does not cover?
- Are there any limitations in my product that might prevent me from successfully implementing side navigation as proposed?
- Is there anything else you would like us to think about?

Thank you so much for taking the time to review the proposed guidelines for side navigation and providing your feedback! We appreciate your time and contributions. Once we review the feedback from the community, we will make necessary revisions and the  component will be added to Modus after the final approval from the UX Board.
