Modus 1.0 is finally here! The official release of Modus, the Trimble Design System has much to offer for designers, engineers, and product managers. We have listened to you and made significant improvements based on your feedback.

## What’s New

### Modus website gets a facelift

We have improved the aesthetic of the site and the navigation to account for additional content. It's also much faster and mobile-optimized.

### Modus focuses on community engagement

Modus is a community effort. Your contributions are key to the success of the design system. The new community section aims to improve and increase communication about our efforts, progress, and opportunities for engagement. Here’s where you’ll find information on how to contribute to Modus, submission guidelines, Tiger Team formation, Modus news, and updates.

### The style guide is now separated from Bootstrap code

In anticipation of adding more code libraries to Modus, we have separated the code from the style guide. It will also allow us to develop new component definitions and patterns independently of the development timeline.

### Modus has built-in accessibility

To help your team build a culture of inclusivity for our customers, we have added accessibility guidelines and resources to Modus. We also revised every component to meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA standards.

### Icon design is standardized and usage defined

To help Trimble build a consistent and branded icon library, we created icon design and usage guidelines.

### Modus foundations and component usage guidance augmented

The foundations section has expanded to include logo usage guidelines, writing and language style guide, responsive grid, and more. We also revised usage information for each component.

### You can now search Modus

We added a site-wide search with an auto-complete function and filters to make it easier for you to find information. We will also be able to track search keywords to help us understand your needs.

### Modus now includes a Figma pattern library

Along with Sketch, Modus now offers a Figma library.

## Tell Us What You Think!

We want to hear from you, our users, so we can curate Modus to meet your needs: bring you new features, libraries, and components that you are looking for. In a few weeks, we will send out a survey. Please, make sure you make your voice heard and share your Modus experience with us.
