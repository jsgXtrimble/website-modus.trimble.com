Dear Trimble UX Community,

The Tables Tiger Team has proposed improvements to the existing table component. Please, review the documentation, specifications, and mockups and provide your feedback below by **Thursday, November 4**.

- [Tables component guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JwHy6Hqrj5EJY6deM5382STvM4InvV3OTdci4f1b9Ac/edit?usp=sharing)

- [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/ZefO0mphKBer3MMDPGtQbY/Tiger-Team-Table-Component-Draft?node-id=14%3A73)

When reviewing the documentation, take under consideration the needs of your product as well as other products at Trimble. Some questions you may want to ask during your review:

- Are these table options going to work for my product?
- Does my product have a specific need or functionality that this proposal does not cover?
- Are there any limitations in my product that might prevent me from successfully implementing any of the tables proposed?
- Is there anything else you would like us to think about?

Thank you so much for taking the time to review the proposed improvements to our tables and providing your feedback! We appreciate your time and contributions. Once we review the feedback from the community, we will make necessary revisions and the improved component will be added to Modus after the final approval of the UX Board.
