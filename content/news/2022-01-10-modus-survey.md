Looking back at the past year, we have done much improvements to Modus. But that's just the beginning! We want to know what else you would like us to improve and add to meet your needs and the needs of your team. As a member of the Trimble UX, engineering, or product management community at Trimble, your feedback is crucial!

The survey will only take a few minutes! Please, take the **[survey](https://forms.gle/HPt5LQaL7KuQSVHE9)** by next **Friday, January 21**, so we can learn how to serve you better. You don't use Modus? Tell us why not.
