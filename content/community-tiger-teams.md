## Tiger Team Process

### 1. Answer the call!

When a story moves from the backlog into the Discovery column on the DDS Kanban board, Trimble UX community is notified (via email, chat, and newsletter on the Modus website) soliciting Tiger Team members. In order to be part of the team, you should

- have some expertise on the subject,
- be currently working on the component on your product team,
- or have vested interest in the component because of its prevalence in the product you are working on

AND

- have some time you can devote to the project (2-4 hours per week).

Once you express your interest, the Modus Product Manager will contact your manager to secure his/ her permission to divide your time between your team and the design system.

### 2. UX Board review of candidates

The board will review the volunteers to make sure the team has a good representation from different divisions, and it will choose a leader for the team.

### 3. Kick-off meeting

The Modus Product Manager will schedule an introductory kick-off meeting to discuss the problem the team is going to solve, acceptance criteria, responsibilities, [submission guidelines](/community/submission-guidelines/), set up a schedule for regular meetings, and agree on a tentative deadline.

### 4. Working sessions

The team members will meet weekly to collaborate on the best way to solve the problem and provide recommendations taking under consideration the needs of other divisions. They will also communicate through a group chat to share ideas, files, and information. **Your enthusiasm is prerequisite, but your diligence in putting in the work and actively participating is the key to your teamâ€™s success.**

### 5. Recommendation reviews

Once the team feels they have a good recommendation, they will share it with the Modus Product Manager, who will make sure that all the acceptance criteria are met. Then the leader will present the documentation and proposed designs to the UX Board.

### 6. Feedback

The UX Board and the UX community will have two weeks to review the recommendation, to conduct a heuristic evaluation, and to provide feedback. The feedback and any objections will be documented, discussed, and shared with the Tiger Team leader.

### 7. Revisions and final approvals

The team will address any objections and provide revisions to their recommendations. If no revisions are necessary, the component is going to move into production to be added to Modus. A pattern is accepted, when

- It meets acceptance criteria;
- It is in agreement with foundations and Modus style;
- It passes the heuristic review criteria without any recommendations.

Congratulations! You are a Modus hero!

We will reach out to the community, when we need volunteers. Please, visit [the backlog](https://github.com/orgs/trimble-oss/projects/5/views/1) to see what's coming up or [contact us](/community/contact/).
