## Modus is a Community Effort

Modus is owned and created by the Development Community of Trimble.  With your contributions,  the system can constantly get updated and improved.  Contributions can include for example, a new design component, a set of icons, the expression of the existing components in a pattern library for a  new  design  tool, or the addition of modus components in a new development  stack, or even just your feedback and request for features that would make Modus more useful to you. Trimble community member contributions are what make Modus great! Thank you for your continued support!

## The Modus Community

The Modus design system strives to follow a distributed model in order to foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing. The Trimble community of enthusiastic and knowledgeable designers and developers are an essential and intrinsic part of the design system, and it relies on your active contributions. Modus design guidelines run an open-source model, where everyone is allowed and encouraged to contribute, but contributions are managed and curated by a design system product manager and a community sources set of advisors, the curators.

### Users

Modus users are members of the Trimble community who use the design system for guidelines, design assets, and code libraries. Anyone can be a user, and we encourage users to participate and provide feedback.
