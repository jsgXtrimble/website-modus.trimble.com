## Overview

Figma is a vector graphics editor and prototyping tool, which is primarily web-based with additional offline features enabled by desktop applications for MacOS and Windows. As we build out the Modus Design System this is one of the many files that will be continually supported and maintained. Follow the instructions below to obtain the kit and add it to your project.

## 1. Sign Up for Figma

## 8. Give Your Library Some Context

A good description will help your team maintain a clean and organized document.

## 9. Select “Publish”

This will give a status of the library being published. You will see that on the bottom.
Once published, your library will be available to your team! Congratulations!

## Enable Library on Files or Drafts

Typically the library will be enabled in all the new files that are created. However, if it is not, here is how you fix it.

- Go back to the main “files” page and select your Profile.
- Under the “Settings” tab you will find a section titled “Library”
- Select “Enable Libraries”
- Toggle on the “Modus Design System”
- Congrats!

## Enjoy! But Check Back Soon!

The file you copied will not receive any updates or changes to the Figma file. We will push any changes to the larger community, so you can copy over the new components.

_Note:_ This is a temporary solution as our Licensing team is working on a larger Enterprise license to make this process seamless. Look out for updates!
