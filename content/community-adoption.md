The adoption of a design system has been widely recognized by organizations to add substantial value in terms of consistency, design and development cost savings, and scalability But having recognized the efficacy of a design system and decided to adopt it, how do you affect implementation?

## Planning

After the initial discovery of the design system and a decision to implement it, your team prepares for implementation by doing a feasibility assessment, roadmap review, and system audit. The team will review the design system and its code stacks in order to assess the implementation effort. It is crucial to involve the entire team, including the designers, developers, and QA. Developers and QA will need to assess the risks and consider test environments and safe code merge protocols to minimize the probability of breaking the product.

Then you will need to review the roadmap and build the design system implementation into your plan. Depending on your product the adoption effort will vary and so will the timeframe for the adoption. It’s rare that a roadmap will allow for a wholesale implementation: the design system work usually needs to take place alongside other features and releases. But working under Agile methodologies and the design system’s modularity allows for incremental implementation.

A system audit will help determine what parts of your product--elements, components, and patterns--are the most dissimilar and aid in prioritization. This step involves gathering screenshots of your product and documenting changes. You can do that electronically using Miro board and spreadsheets or the old-fashioned way by printing out screenshots, pasting them on a white board, and using PostIt notes to add comments. Once the audit is complete, your team should have a very good understanding of the effort involved.

## Adoption

The design system work has been added to your roadmap, the effort has been assessed and documented, and the work prioritized. At this time, you will break the work out into stories and add them to your backlog. To help your team with prioritization of stories, we developed an incremental adoption plan, which ensure that
Standards rollout in phases that don’t overwhelm your development,
You integrate small parts one at a time while working on other features,
Lines of business bring their products up to date little by little.

The following plan is broken down into four levels of achievement: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. We allow for 6 months to complete a level. It’s a conservative estimate that will allow your team to work on other features of your product. However, you may choose a different approach and decrease this timeline. Some teams were able to complete Modus implementation within a few months.

### Levels of Achievement

#### BRONZE LEVEL: Foundational Alignment (6 months)
- {{< checklist >}}Logo Usage
- {{< checklist >}}Fonts
- {{< checklist >}}Color Palette & Variables
- {{< checklist >}}Header
- {{< checklist >}}Icons

#### SILVER LEVEL: Major Components  (6 months)
- {{< checklist >}}Buttons
- {{< checklist >}}Inputs
- {{< checklist >}}Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, Switches
- {{< checklist >}}Cards or Tables (prioritize based on prominence in your product)
- {{< checklist >}}Typography Classes
- {{< checklist >}}Responsive Grid & Spacing

#### GOLD LEVEL: Styles & Accessibility (6 months)
- {{< checklist >}}Writing Style
- {{< checklist >}}Alerts, Messages, Toasts
- {{< checklist >}}Dialogs
- {{< checklist >}}Tabs or Accordions (prioritize based on prominence in your product)
- {{< checklist >}}Cards or Tables (whichever is left over)
- {{< checklist >}}Accessibility

#### PLATINUM LEVEL: Other Minor Elements (6 months)
- {{< checklist >}}Tabs or Accordions (whichever is left over)
- {{< checklist >}}Badges
- {{< checklist >}}Dropdowns
- {{< checklist >}}Chips
- {{< checklist >}}Sliders
- {{< checklist >}}Progress Bars, Spinners
- {{< checklist >}}Pagination
- {{< checklist >}}Tooltips
- {{< checklist >}}Breadcrumbs
- {{< checklist >}}Lists

If each stage takes 6 months to complete, your product should be fully aligned with Modus in two years.

## Maintenance & Loyalty

Once you reach full alignment, the bulk of the work is done. Now, the effort in designing and developing new features is going to be much smaller. The designers have UI kits (Sketch, Figma, and Adobe XD) to quickly prototype and developers have consistent and ready-made code components.

As the design system evolves to expand its components, elements, patterns, and code stacks to meet the needs of the organization and improve based on new trends in the industry, new technologies, and user research, your product will require ongoing maintenance in order to retain consistency. Since your product will already be Modus-compliant. every new feature or pattern your team develops can be contributed back to the system for use across other products.

When your team adopts the Modus Design System, we would like you to become an advocate and share with other teams your success story. We would also like to learn about your process, challenges, and experience in design system adoption, so we can continually improve the design system to meet your needs. If your team has already begun adoption, you can track your progress in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VtOaE6x8slBvT3Xy3eJL_nKHWprIq-VEXw1YxuPH4Bo/edit#gid=0).
