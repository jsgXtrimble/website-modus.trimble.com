### Symbols

![Symbols](/img/guide/designer_04_Symbols_elements.png)

Modus components, live in the design kit as Sketch symbols.

#### Library menu navigation

- There are two kinds of symbols — library symbols and document symbols. Library symbols are available in any Sketch document, while document symbols are specific to the document in which they are found.
- From the Insert menu, select Symbols → Modus Design System to add symbols onto your page.
- Modus symbols are built to be flexible, and designers should not detach symbols from the library. Once a symbol is detached, you will no longer receive updates as they are released.

#### Structure

Symbols are organized by component; after selecting a component, you’ll see the variations and states of that component.

- To add the whole component, select the desired variant and place it on your artboard.
- For even more configurability, use the individual building blocks found under the Items folder within the symbol where available. Be sure your custom design adheres to our design guidelines.

### Text styles

Text styles are based on typography rules defined by the Modus Design System.

![Text Styles](/img/guide/designer_05_Text_styles.png)

#### Library menu navigation

From the main menu select Insert → Text Styles → Modus Design System to insert a Modus type token text style.
Text styles within components are carefully considered. We do not recommend detaching the symbol to change default styles.

#### Structure

Modus text styles in Sketch are organized similarly to symbols.

#### Layer styles

Layer styles are color selections for any shape in Sketch.

_Use predetermined overrides when possible_

#### Library menu navigation

Color in Modus is carefully considered, and we discourage custom layer styles

### Info

- If you’re brand new to Sketch, you can review [tutorials and help docs](https://www.sketchapp.com/docs/).

### Updates

- We make small adjustments and bug fixes to the kit on a regular basis. When we make a change to any of the libraries, you will be notified via a red pop-up in the top right corner of the Sketch window.
- The updates are opt-in, however we recommend you keep your kit as up to date as possible. Once a change is accepted, you will not be able to revert to the previous version.
