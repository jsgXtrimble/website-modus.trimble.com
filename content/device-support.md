The Trimble suite of products spans a plethora of business sectors, technology platforms (e.g. web-based, mobile, desktop, etc), frontend languages and technology stacks (e.g. Angular, Java, HTML/CSS, etc), work applications (in office, in the field, in a machine, etc) and devices (tablets, phones, laptops, desktops, and Trimble HW). In order to ensure different teams can build beautiful, consistent user experiences, the current release of Modus is targeted at the supported environments outlined below.

## Currently Supported

### Web-Based Software

Software that is built to be viewed on a web browser on a desktop, tablet, and/or other mobile device. The content adapts to different screen sizes. Modus provides a responsive grid and design patterns that reflect best usability practices for all breakpoints.

### In-Field Software

The in-field, high-contrast library is specific to applications used outdoors on handheld or in-cab devices where the environmental conditions cannot be controlled. These applications are built to meet the users’ special needs, such as challenging outdoor lighting, moving or vibrating devices, and/or impeding protective clothing.

## Technology Stacks

Modus recommends developers use the Modus [Web Components](https://modus-web-components.trimble.com/?path=/story/introduction-welcome--page) library, which is framework-agnostic. We also currently support [Bootstrap](https://modus-bootstrap.trimble.com/) and [React-Bootstrap](https://modus-react-bootstrap.trimble.com/) components.

## Coming Soon

### Mobile Applications

Modus supports native, hybrid, and web-based apps designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone or a tablet. Currently, we do not support watch patterns.

### Desktop Software

A desktop application runs on a computer or device locally and is built to be installed in the environment of the device’s operating system (i.e. Microsoft Windows).

### VR/ XR Environments

Modus will soon provide UX patterns for Trimble built HW, and/or mixed-reality devices, such as the Microsoft HoloLens.
