The Trimble suite of products spans a plethora of business sectors, technology platforms (e.g. mobile, desktop app, desktop SW, etc), front end languages and technology stacks (e.g. Angular, Java, HTML/CSS, etc), work applications, (in office, in the field, in a machine, etc) and devices (tablets, phones, laptops, desktops, and Trimble HW). In order to ensure different teams can build beautiful user experiences, this first release of Modus is targeted at the supported environments outlined below.

## Currently Supported

### Web-Based Software

Software that is built to be viewed on a web browser on a desktop, tablet, and/or other mobile device. The content adapts to different screen sizes. Modus provides a responsive grid and design patterns that reflect best usability practices for all breakpoints.

### Desktop Software

A desktop application runs on a computer or device locally and is built to be installed in the environment of the deviceâ€™s operating system (i.e. Microsoft Windows).

## Technology Stacks

Modus currently supports developers who can leverage HTML/CSS. Stacks and technologies such as Angular Material and React are currently out of scope and will be included at a later date.

### Mobile Applications

Modus supports native, hybrid, and web-based apps designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone or a tablet. Currently, we do not support watch patterns.

### Work Applications

Modus is currently targeted at in-office and low contrast working conditions. Modus is not ideally crafted for scenarios of high sunlight, high vibration, and field applications.

## Future Support

Modus currently does not provide support for software run on in-cab hardware or field solutions such as freight, fleet, earthmoving, marine or agriculture. Modus does not provide guidance for Trimble built HW,  and/or mixed-reality devices, such as the Microsoft HoloLens. There are, however, other work groups [addressing such initiatives](/start).
